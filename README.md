## Map Marker
This is an application that lets users mark google maps with custom stamps and markers inspired by the map in Zelda: Breath of the Wild 
#### Inspiration
This application is inspired by the way that people use maps in games such as Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I find that organizing the purposes of locations in a map based way to be very intuitive, yet I only do this in video games. So the goal of this application is to satisfy my need to organie my life through a geographical lens.
